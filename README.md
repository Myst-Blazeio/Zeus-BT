## **Problem Statement: Mentorship Platform for SLIET**
Overview  
Mentorship is a powerful tool for guiding students through their academic and career journeys. With SLIETâ€™s focus on nurturing talent, a mentorship platform can create new opportunities by connecting SLIET faculty members with students who need career advice, academic support, or skill-building guidance.

The goal of this challenge is to build a dedicated mentorship website for SLIET, where faculty members from our college act as mentors, offering their time to help students with academic and career-related queries. This platform will allow students to book one-on-one sessions with faculty mentors based on their availability, fostering smooth communication and personalized guidance within the SLIET community.

This initiative will strengthen student-faculty interactions, providing continuous support and enhancing the personal and professional growth of students at SLIET.
